Training
------------
To automatically detect LAS, you need to train two models:
- **Deformable image registration model** (self-supervised, no groundtruth annotations necessary)
- **Segmentation model** for at least the left ventricle (we used bi-ventricular segmentation from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ub.edu/mnms-2/">M&Ms-2</a>

### Deformable image registration model
Our trainings script supports single- and multi-GPU training (local or  cluster). Trainings work-flow:
1. **Config setup**
   - Start from or modify an example config in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cardio-AI/cmr-multi-view-phase-detection/tree/main/data/configs">data/configs</a>
2. **Run Training**
      ```
    python src/models/train_regression_model.py \
   - cfg_reg <path_to_config> \
   - data_json <path_to_dataset_json> \
   - data <data_root> \
   - inmemory <true/false>         
    ```
    -  ```cfg_reg ```: Path to an experiment config (examples in ```data/configs```)
    - ```data```: Root folder with 3d nrrd or nii.gz files (4CH single slice cine CMR; see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cardio-AI/cmr-multi-view-phase-detection/tree/main/docs/Data.md">data/Data</a>)
    - ```data_json```: Path to dataset.json, which contains all necessary information about labels, suffix and post-processing  (examples in ```data/configs```).
    - ```inmemory```: Enables in-memory pre-processing for cluster-based trainings

3.  **Cross Validation**
    - Script can train on multiple folds sequentially (defined in config ```"FOLDS":[0, 1, 2, 3],```). For multi-fold splits, you must supply a **_df_kfold.csv_** file (see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cardio-AI/cmr-multi-view-phase-detection/tree/main/docs/Data.md">data/Data</a>)
    - If no folds are provided, the model is trained on all available data
    - After training, predictions ar automatically saved into f0-f3 subfolders. 

4.  **Outputs per fold**
   ```
   ├── config (config used in this experiment fold)
   ├── Log_errors.log (logging.error logfile)
   ├── Log.log (console and trainings progress logs, if activated
   ├── model (model graph and weights for later usage
   ├── model.png (graph as model png)
   ├── model_summary.txt (layer input/output shapes as structured txt file
   └── tensorboard_logs (tensorboard logfiles: train-/test scalars and model predictions per epoch)
   ```
   
### Segmentation model
For segmentation, we used the publicly available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet"> nnU-Net </a>  framework. 
Please use 2D 4CH cine CMR images for the training of the model. 

Note: nnU-Net does not support time sequences. Our pipeline processes each timestep independently and assembles cine masks.

Segmentation labels:
- LV bloodpool: 1
- LV MYO (with septum): 2
- RV bloodpool: 3
