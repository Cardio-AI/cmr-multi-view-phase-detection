Abstract
=
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing cardiac function, but individual cardiac
cycles complicate automatic temporal comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection 
can eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED) 
frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion.

We propose a self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis (SAX) and four-chamber 
long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable registration fields are derived from the images and used 
to compute a 1D motion descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction and 
relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are determined using a simple set of rules.

The method was independently evaluated for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. 
M&Ms-2 (n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC (n=100) datasets for 
repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested 
using the German Competence Network (GCN) dataset.

Our self-supervised approach achieved improved detection accuracy by 30\% - 51\% for SAX and 11\% - 47\% for 4CH  
in ED and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the volume-based approach.  
We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD 
below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and intra-patient 
analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase lengths.

  abstract="Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cardiac MRI) is the gold standard for quantifying ventricular function, from which several parameters are derived. Among these, long-axis strain (LAS) is valuable for diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Unlike global longitudinal strain (GLS), which needs multi-plane imaging, LAS can be effectively derived from a single-plane four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cardiac MRI. Conventional analysis focuses on end-diastolic (ED) to end-systolic (ES) LAS, overlooking intermediate dynamics that could help distinguish diseases.
In this study, we present a novel framework for estimating left ventricular LAS across five cardiac phases. The proposed method combines a self-supervised deformable image registration model for key frame detection with a supervised segmentation for landmark identification. LAS is calculated between ED and intermediate phases K (ED2K) and between consecutive phases (K2K).
The methodology was developed and validated on the publicly available M&M2 dataset. The evaluation demonstrated significant differences between healthy individuals and patients with four of the seven cardiac diseases investigated not only in ED2ES, but also mid-systole to ES and ES to peak-flow. This emphasizes the diagnostic potential of phase-specific LAS analysis. The method is fully automated and fast, underscoring its potential for clinical application. The code and reference annotations will be made publicly available. .",
